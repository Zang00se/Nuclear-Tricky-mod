# Nuclear-Tricky-mod
This is a re-skin mod for Tricky and other backgrounds! Story: "Oh no! Auditor went a bit haywire and nuked Nevada! Tricky has been covered in nuclear substances and he thinks you were the one causing it!"
1. You must have WinRAR if you don't, then install it. (it doesn't cost money)
2. Once you have it installed, open the file and it might say purchase winRAR ignore that, once you see the "Nuclear_Tricky" in winRAR you want to then press "Extract to..." (It's at the top)
I would recommend extracting it to your Desktop for quick launch (but you don't have to, and I'm going to assume you know to extract.)
3. Once the file is out of the zip folder you can play! (The .exe file is included so you can start playing instantly by opening the .exe file!)
